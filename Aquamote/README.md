# Aquamote Root

* __Aquamote_PCB_Files:__ As the name suggests, this directory holds all the files for the Aquamote Printed Circuit Board. The design was done in-house and most of the .zip archives in this directory hold the output files necessary for manufacturing.
* __CA-SDK_Files:__ This is an old directory that is _not_ maintained. It holds the software files for early versions of the firmware that were developed before the switch to TI's Code Composer Studio.
* __CAD_Files:__ This directory holds the CAD design files for the waterproof enclosure for the Aquamote device + Battery.
* __Firmware3.x:__ This directory holds all the necessary source code for the CC2650 Firmware.
* __Parser_Files:__ This directory holds various post-processing parsers written in Python.
* __GettingStarted.pdf:__ Look at this file *first* before starting firmware development. It explains all the steps necessary to set up your development machine properly as far as software is concerned.
* __User's Manual.pdf:__ This document outlines how to use the Aquamote device to collect data from a user's perspective, assuming you have not modified the firmware yourself. It was written for the Aquamote3.1 version, however the differences in version 3.2 are not great.
