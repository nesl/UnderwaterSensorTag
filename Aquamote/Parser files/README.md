# Parsers

* __DeploymentGraph and zoom-in.ipynb:__ Special parser designed for processing raw data collected from a deployment. The goal is to visualize the data and create useful plots.
* __parser.py:__ Similar to *parser_aquamote.py* below, but with a couple of slight changes.
* __parser_aquamote.py:__ This is the main parser used to convert the raw data extracted from an Aquamote device into a .csv file that can be used for further processing.
* __speedsensor_parser.ipynb:__ Special parser designed for extracting and converting data from an Aquamote equipped with an additional speed sensor. The sensor was designed by our collaborators in KAUST, and works based on flex.
